# MonopolyWithCSharp

It is still on developing.
I tried to run OOP by making Monopoly
Please give me any feedback if you have

I defined classes as "added" if they can at least work properly
I defined classes as "developing" if they work partially many changes are sill expected
Refactoring is still needed for all the classes
